/*---------- Question One--------------------------------------------
Suppose a student has taken end-of-term exams in Math, English, Science, and Social
Studies, and their scores are stored in four variables as follows:
phpCopy code
$mathScore = 80; // out of 100 $englishScore = 70; // out of 100 $scienceScore = 90;
// out of 100 $socialStudiesScore = 75; // out of 100
Write a PHP if statement to calculate the student's final grade based on the following
grading scale:
• A: average score >= 90
• B: 80 <= average score < 90
• C: 70 <= average score < 80
• D: 60 <= average score < 70
• F: average score < 60
Your if statement should output the student's average score and final grade.
